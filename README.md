# Module Madness

This assignment uses Node.js to create a random number, converts it to USD currency, and reports as 'account balance.'

### Features

#### Feature One

This assignment contains several modules from different JS files.  They are linked together through the require() function.

#### Feature Two

This project will create a random number, strip all values lower than two decimal places, convert the number to a USD value with appropriate comma placement, and report the result through string concatenation.  This is accomplished across four separate JS files.

### Usage

To run this project, you will need node installed.  Follow these steps:

- Download the project.
- Navigate to the project directory.
- In the terminal, run 'node app.js'
- When node is ready, open a new terminal tab
- In the terminal, run 'curl localhost:3000'
- You should see an account balance with a random USD value reported to the left of the command prompt.  Continue running for different results.
- Make sure to close node (Control + C) before closing the terminal
